                        <p> 
                            This project involved undertaking user research and partially redesigning a website for an Australian not-for-profit 
                            organisation that would be responsive across two different devices. Assistive Technology Australia was selected as 
                            the not-for-profit organisation for this task, and the website was redesigned to be responsive across iPhone 8 and desktop screens. <br> <br>
                            The approach taken for this project focused on: 
                            <ol>
                            <li>Simplifying the process of registering for a course 
                            <li>Streamlining the payment process by adopting an online payment system instead of completing a PDF form and sending it back to the organisation. 
                            <li>Replacing the browsealoud accessibility toolbar with the the UserWay floating accessibility menu
                            <li>Developing and implementing a style guide/design system
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                            A wide range of products can fall into this category including non-slip mats, 
                            walking sticks, wheelchairs, an app that can helps people with vision-impairment

                            Also, one interviewee suffers from lupus and another was a special needs assistant at a school. 
                            The special needs assistant was familiar some assistive technology products that were used to help students in their learning.

                            From this, we were able to extract findings, needs/wants and pain points of the users.

                            The colours selected incorporated the brand colours used by Assistive Technology Australia. 
                            Effort was made to ensure that the colour combinations used were compliant with the WCAG 2.0 standard 
                            and in most cases, they were also compliant with the WCAG 3.0 standard. 
                            This was checked using colour-contrast checking tools. The fonts used were selected because research 
                            showed that were considered to be accessible fonts.

                        <h2>Testing & Improving</h2>
                        <p> 
                            In the research phase of the project, a remote guerilla usability test of the current 
                            Assistive Technology Australia desktop website was conducted. 
                            Three participants voluntary took part in this test over Zoom in order to indentify 
                            some of the areas for improvement. Some notable findings from this test found:
                            <ol> 
                                <li> There was no filtering system to narrow down the number of training courses </li>
                                <li> The process of registering for a training course was somewhat inconvenient. 
                                    Users must complete a general registration PDF form and then email it back 
                                    to Assistive Technology Australia. The user must also provide their payment information 
                                    (credit card details) in this form
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The accessibility toolbar was difficult to locate and operate. 
                                    It was somewhat discrete and lacked descriptive features or onboarding to help 
                                    the user understand how it functions
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            The mid-fidelity clickable mobile prototype was also tested in a remote guerilla 
                            test over Zoom before the high-fidelity mobile and desktop prototypes were developed. 
                            <br>
                            The main feedback from this test was:
                            <ol>
                                <li> Increasing the font size </li>
                                <li> Adding a prompt to the accessibility widget </li>
                                <li> Provide some more spacing between elements so that it does not look congested </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            A/B testing was conducted to see users' preference of certain aspects of the high-fidelity 
                            mobile prototype. Three user took part in this remote guerilla test over Zoom. 
                            These changes were then implemented in the high-fidelity mobile and desktop prototypes.
